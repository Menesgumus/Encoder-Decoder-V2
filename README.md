Features:
Random Key Generation: The program can generate a random key of any specified length.
Text Encryption & Decryption: Encrypt or decrypt text using a secure cipher based on a key of your choice.
Character Set: The tool supports a wide range of characters, including uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and some special characters.
Key Extension: Automatically extends the key to match the length of the input text for proper encryption/decryption.
Cross-platform: Written in C++, making it easy to compile and run on any platform with a C++ compiler.


How to Use:
Choose whether you want to Encrypt or Decrypt.
Input the text you want to work with. This can include letters, numbers, and other characters.
Enter a key for encryption or decryption:
For encryption, a random key will be generated, or you can provide your own.
For decryption, you must enter the correct key used during encryption.
The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed on the screen.
Example:

Encryption:

Text: "HELLO WORLD 123"
Key: "SECRET"
Encrypted Text: "VGUFQ YVZSG 456"


Decryption:

Text: "VGUFQ YVZSG 456"
Key: "SECRET"
Decrypted Text: "HELLO WORLD 123"
